                The Punjab Group of Colleges (the Punjab Group) is an association of universities and colleges within Pakistan.
				PGC came into being as The Islamic Commerce Educational Society (ICES), registered in 1985,
				which established its first facility, the Punjab College of Commerce, in Muslim Town on Canal Bank in Lahore,
				followed a few years later by the Punjab Law College.
                Since then the Punjab Group has successfully branched out into various cities of Punjab.
				Following arrangements with foreign accredited universities,
                Punjab College of Business Administration (PCBA) was established in 1991 and Punjab Institute of Computer Science
				(PICS), in 1993, at Lahore.In less than five years both institutions emerged as highly specialized schools, training individuals as successful
				professional managers and computer scientists.
                Now we introduced Allied School (A Project of Punjab Group Colleges).
                Today, in a world where society is increasingly fragmented and polarized, our school remains a community where honesty
				and integrity matter
               , humor and hard work are equally important values, and where the process of education is as important as the grade.
                Allied School (A Project of Punjab Group Colleges)aims to provide a sound English medium education within our cultural
				religious and historical frame-work.
                We aim to empower the future generations of Pakistan to meet the challenges of an ever-changing world through quality
				teaching, quality training,
                quality management, thereby benefiting the community, the country and the wider world.
                 The faculty of the Punjab Group’s educational institutions includes 79 foreign and 9 local PhDs, and 47 foreign and
				 1200 local master's degree holders.</p>
